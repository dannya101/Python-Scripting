# Python-Scripting
This project shows basic scripting to allow to run multiple different files that are different languages  

Main code is wrapper.py file which runs all the subprocesses

## To run this program 
1. First download the zipfile
2. Also you will need MATLAB installed, and all the compilers, C compiler (gcc), Haskell compiler (ghc), prolog compiler (swipl).
3. Then once you have downloaded everything successfully open up any environment, like VSCode
4. Once you have the environment open, unzip the repository you downloaded and open the folder in your environment
5. Next once you have the folder open in your environment open the wrapper.py file and proceed to run it or by calling python wrapper.py to run exe.
6. This may take some time but it once it has started to run you should see Running MATLAB CODE 1
7. Once all programs are ran you should see a seperate tab open up showing the results of different programs ran

If you would like to change the image feel free to go into the matlabcode1.m file and change "mickey.png" to "hotdogdog.jpeg", then run the wrapper file again.
